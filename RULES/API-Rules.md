# Python API Call Best Practices

Following these best practices will help ensure clean and readable code when making API calls within Python using basic libraries. The rules are based on PEP 8 and PEP 257 guidelines.

## Rule 1: Import Libraries Properly

Import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your script, following PEP 8 guidelines for import statements.

"""
import requests
import json

Rule 2: Use Descriptive Names
Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions, following PEP 8 naming conventions.


response = requests.get(url)
Rule 3: Maintain Consistent Indentation
Use consistent indentation with 4 spaces for each level, as recommended by PEP 8. Do not use tabs for indentation.

"""
def make_api_call(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None


Rule 4: Separate Top-Level Definitions
Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines, as suggested by PEP 8. This visually separates different sections of your code.

"""
import requests


def make_api_call(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None


Rule 5: Add Module-Level Docstrings
Add module-level docstrings using triple double quotes to provide a summary of the API call's purpose, parameters, and return values, following PEP 257 conventions.

"""
import requests


def make_api_call(url):
    
    Makes an API call to the specified URL and returns the response in JSON format.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL of the API endpoint.

    Returns:
        dict or None: The response in JSON format if the request is successful, None otherwise.
    """
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return None
"""

Rule 6: Use Inline Comments Sparingly
Use inline comments sparingly and only when necessary to explain complex logic or edge cases. Comments should be clear and concise, helping other developers understand your code.


response = requests.get(url)

# Check if the response is successful (status code 200)
if response.status_code == 200:
    return response.json()
else:
    return None

Rule 7: Follow Additional Guidelines
Follow other relevant guidelines specified in PEP 8 and PEP 257.

Limit line length to 79 characters.
Use a space before and after binary operators, commas, colons, and semicolons.
Use a space after a comma in function calls and definitions, but not between the argument and its default value.
Avoid extraneous whitespace within parentheses, brackets, and braces.
Remember to always consider the specific coding style guide of the library or framework you are using, as they might have their own conventions and recommendations.

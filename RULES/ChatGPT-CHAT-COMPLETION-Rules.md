# OpenAI ChatGPT Completion Calls Rules

This document outlines the rules for using OpenAI's ChatGPT completion calls. Adhering to these rules will ensure that our usage of the API is efficient, effective, and in line with OpenAI's guidelines.

## 1. API Key Security

- Never expose your OpenAI API key in your code or version control system. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems to handle your API keys. This is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to your OpenAI account.

## 2. Rate Limiting

- Be aware of OpenAI's rate limits. As of the last update, free trial users have a rate limit of 20 requests per minute (RPM) and 40000 tokens per minute (TPM). Pay-as-you-go users in their first 48 hours have a limit of 60 RPM and 60000 TPM, and after 48 hours, the limit is 3500 RPM and 90000 TPM.
- Implement a rate limiting handler in your code to prevent exceeding these limits. This handler should wait and retry when the rate limit is exceeded.

## 3. Input Length

- The total number of tokens in an API call (input and output included) cannot exceed OpenAI's maximum limit (4096 tokens as of the last update). Ensure your prompts do not cause this limit to be exceeded.
- Implement a token counter in your code to keep track of the number of tokens in your prompt and the generated text.

## 4. Output Length

- Be mindful of the `max_tokens` option in the API call. Setting it too high might lead to unnecessary costs, while setting it too low might result in outputs that don't make sense.
- Choose a `max_tokens` value that is appropriate for your use case. For example, if you are generating a paragraph of text, you might set `max_tokens` to 100.

## 5. Temperature and Top-P

- Understand the `temperature` and `top_p` parameters. `Temperature` controls the randomness of the output (higher values make the output more random), while `top_p` controls nucleus sampling and can be used to limit the randomness by cutting off unlikely options.
- Choose `temperature` and `top_p` values that are appropriate for your use case. For example, if you want a single coherent output, you might set `temperature` to a low value.

## 6. Prompt Design

- Design your prompts to guide the model towards the desired output. You can ask the model to think step by step, debate pros and cons, or use any other strategy that helps in getting the desired output.
- Experiment with different prompt designs to find what works best for your use case. Remember that the model doesn't understand the task, it's just predicting the next piece of text based on the prompt.

## 7. Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling for API calls. Handle different types of exceptions that can occur, such as rate limit errors, validation errors, and server errors.
- Log the error details for debugging purposes. This includes the error message, status code, and any other relevant information.

## 8. Testing

- Thoroughly test your integration with the OpenAI API. Ensure that your application handles different types of inputs and scenarios correctly.
- Write automated tests for your code. This includes tests for successful API calls, rate limiting, error handling, and more.

## 9. Monitoring and Logging

- Monitor your usage of the OpenAI API and log important events. This can help you understand your usage patterns, debug issues, and control costs.
- Use amonitoring and logging system to track API usage, errors, response times, and any other relevant metrics.
- Regularly review your logs to identify any anomalies or potential issues with your API integration.

## 10. Respect OpenAI's Usage Policies

- Familiarize yourself with OpenAI's usage policies and adhere to them. Ensure that your usage of the ChatGPT API complies with OpenAI's guidelines and terms of service.
- If you have any questions or uncertainties about the appropriate use of the API, reach out to OpenAI for clarification.

By following these rules, you can effectively and responsibly use OpenAI's ChatGPT completion calls while maintaining security, efficiency, and compliance with OpenAI's guidelines.

# Build Rules

This document outlines the build rules for our projects to ensure the highest level of reliability, safety, readability, maintainability, and overall code quality. All projects should adhere to these rules to maintain a standard of excellence and promote effective collaboration within the development team.

## 1. Reliability and Safety

- All code should prioritize reliability, robustness, and safety.
- Avoid reliance on real-time operations and ensure deterministic behavior.
- Minimize the use of global variables and shared mutable state.
- Thoroughly test the code to validate correctness, stability, and error handling.

## 2. Readability and Maintainability

- Write code that is easily readable, understandable, and maintainable.
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and files.
- Include comments and docstrings to explain purpose, functionality, and assumptions.
- Follow established coding style conventions and formatting guidelines.
- Consider using automatic code formatting tools for consistent style.

## 3. Code Structure and Complexity

- Organize code to minimize complexity and enhance modularity.
- Keep functions, methods, and classes focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid excessive nesting of control structures (e.g., deep if/else statements or nested loops).
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns to promote maintainability and extensibility.
- Encapsulate state and behavior within appropriate classes and objects.
- Minimize dependencies and aim for loose coupling between components.

## 4. Error Handling and Exceptions

- Handle errors and exceptional conditions gracefully.
- Use appropriate exception types to convey and capture exceptional behavior.
- Employ defensive programming techniques to validate inputs and handle edge cases.
- Provide clear and meaningful error messages to aid debugging and troubleshooting.

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write comprehensive automated tests to verify correctness and stability.
- Strive for high code coverage, testing all lines and control flow branches.
- Utilize testing frameworks, tools, and continuous integration for automated testing.
- Use static analysis tools and linters to enforce code quality and standards compliance.
- Regularly review and update tests to prevent regressions.

## 6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

- Document the codebase to facilitate understanding and onboarding.
- Include a README file with project overview, installation instructions, and usage examples.
- Document public APIs, specifying inputs, outputs, and usage guidelines.
- Include a license file (e.g., LICENSE.txt) specifying the project's licensing terms.
- Encourage contributions through a CONTRIBUTING file with guidelines for contributors.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation reflecting code changes and new features.

## 7. Collaboration and Code Review

- Conduct code reviews for all changes before merging into the main codebase.
- Reviewers should assess adherence to code rules, potential issues, and overall quality.
- Use version control effectively to track changes, manage branches, and enable collaboration.
- Foster a positive and constructive code review culture, encouraging feedback and improvement.

## 8. Syntax and Style

- Follow Python's official style guide (PEP 8) for consistent and readable code.
- Use consistent indentation (typically 4 spaces) to enhance code clarity.
- Ensure proper spacing around operators and after commas in function calls.
- Limit line length to 79 characters or use line continuation techniques when necessary.
- Avoid excessive use of parentheses and unnecessary parentheses for function calls.
- Use meaningful variable names that accurately represent their purpose.

## 9. Function and Method Design

- Functions and methods should have clear, descriptive names that convey their purpose.
- Aim to keep functions and methods short and focused on a single task.
- Follow the principle of least astonishment: design functions to behave as expected without unexpected sideeffects.
- Avoid unnecessary global variables and prefer function parameters and return values.

## 10. Data Structures and Types

- Use appropriate data structures and types for the given problem and data requirements.
- Leverage built-in Python data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets) effectively.
- Ensure proper initialization of data structures and handle empty cases gracefully.
- Be aware of Python's mutable and immutable data types and use them appropriately.

## 11. Exception Handling

- Use specific exception handling instead of broad `try-except` blocks when possible.
- Only catch exceptions that you can handle effectively and provide meaningful error messages.
- Avoid bare `except` clauses and prefer catching specific exception types.
- Consider using the `finally` clause for cleanup operations.

## 12. Input Validation and Sanitization

- Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, code injection).
- Use appropriate methods for input validation based on the specific input type and expected format.
- Handle edge cases and incorrect inputs gracefully, providing informative feedback to the user.

## 13. Performance and Efficiency

- Write code that is efficient and optimized for performance where applicable.
- Avoid unnecessary computational overhead, excessive loops, or redundant calculations.
- Leverage built-in Python functions and libraries for efficient operations.
- Be mindful of time and space complexity when designing algorithms.

## 14. Performance Optimization

- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical sections of the code.
- Utilize algorithmic improvements and data structures to improve efficiency.
- Consider caching, memoization, or other techniques to reduce redundant computations.

## 15. Security

- Implement secure coding practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security risks.
- Handle sensitive data and user authentication securely, following best practices and encryption standards.

## 16. Internationalization and Localization

- Design code to support internationalization and localization requirements.
- Externalize user-facing strings to facilitate translation and adaptation to different languages.
- Consider cultural and regional differences when handling date, time, and formatting operations.

## 17. Scalability and Resilience

- Design code and architecture with scalability and resilience in mind.
- Consider distributed systems, load balancing, and fault-tolerant techniques.
- Plan for potential failure scenarios and implement appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## 18. Accessibility

- Design code to be accessible to users with disabilities.
- Follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
- Provide alternative text for images, use semantic HTML elements, and consider keyboard navigation.

## 19. Optimization for Mobile and Low-Bandwidth Environments

- Optimize code and user interfaces for mobile devices and low-bandwidth environments.
- Reduce network requests, compress assets, and prioritize essential content for faster load times.
- Use responsive design techniques to ensure proper rendering across various screen sizes.

## 20. Continuous Improvement

- Encourage a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the development team.
- Regularly review and refine coding practices based on lessons learned and industry best practices.
- Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements, libraries, frameworks, and security updates in the Python ecosystem.
